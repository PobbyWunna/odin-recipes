        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Laphet Thoke or Tea Leaf Salad is not only the most famous 
            and adored of all Burmese salads, it holds a significant 
            cultural importance. Highly regarded as the king of all 
            leaves, laphet is a perfect appetizer, snack, dessert,

            course meal with just a bowl of hot steamed rice. </p>
        <p>Lahpet Thoke is enjoyed for its complex taste, combining

            the diversity and uniqueness of Burmese cuisine.</p>
