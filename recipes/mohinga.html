        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Mohinga (Burmese: မုန့်ဟင်းခါး) is the national dish of Myanmar. 
            Mohinga is fish soup made with rice noodles, typically 
            served as a hearty breakfast. It features a rich broth 
            flavored with lemongrass, turmeric, and fish sauce, often 
            garnished with boiled eggs, cilantro, and crispy fritters.</p>

        <p>Mohinga is readily available in most parts of the country, 
            sold by street hawkers and roadside stalls in larger cities. 
            Mohinga is traditionally eaten for breakfast, but today is 
            eaten at any time of day. Egg, onions or herbs can be added 
            into the dish.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First, make fish stock.</li>
            <li>In a large stockpot, add the whole fish, lemongrass, garlic, 
                chilies, cilantro, turmeric, fish sauce and water.</li>
            <li>Bring it to a boil, then reduce to medium-low heat and 
                simmer for 30 minutes till the fish easily flakes off.</li>
            <li>Take the fish out of the pot, peel the skin off and filet.</li>
            <li>Separate the large fillets and small, disintegrated flakes.</li>
            <li>Save the bones, head and skin as well as lemongrass, chilies 
                and turmeric roots.</li>
            <li>Strain the stock and set aside.</li>
            <li>Next, let's make collagen-rich fish broth.</li>
            <li>Put the fish bones, head and skin along with the herbs saved 
                from fish stock to a pot and add 3 cups of water.</li>
            <li>Season with salt.</li>
            <li>Simmer the soup over medium heat, for an hour till the broth 
                becomes creamy and white.</li>
            <li>Strain the broth and set it aside.</li>
            <li>Now, move onto soup base.</li>
            <li>Pound the shallots, garlic, ginger and lemongrass in a mortar 
                and pestle till it forms a paste.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a pan and sauté the paste for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add paprika. Stir in the small, disintegrated flakes, 
                free from the bones.</li>
            <li>Season with fish sauce and cook for about 10 minutes till 
                all residual liquid dry up.</li>
            <li>Finally, let's make mohinga.</li>
            <li>In a stockpot, bring the strained stock and broth to a 
                boil.</li>
            <li>Add the soup base.</li>
            <li>Make a slurry with the toasted rice powder and 4 tbsp of 
                cold water and stir into the soup.</li>
            <li>Add and cook the pearl onions and banana stem or lotus 
                roots till tender.</li>
            <li>Stir in the large fish fillets.</li>
            <li>Add ground black and white pepper.</li>
            <li>Season to taste and turn the heat off.</li>
            <li>Now, let's assemble it.</li>
            <li>In each bowl, ladle a cup of soup with fish flakes, pearl 
                onions and banana stem or lotus roots over a bundle of 
                rice vermicelli.</li>
            <li>Customize your bowl to your taste with all the garnishes 
                and toppings, lime, cilantro, boiled eggs, crispy fritters 
                and chili flakes.</li>
        </ol>
